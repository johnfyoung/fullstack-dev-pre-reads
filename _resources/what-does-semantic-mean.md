# what is semantic html?

I just looked up semantic:

> relating to meaning in language or logic

It gets a little philosophical I guess:

- What is meaning?
- How do we organize what is meaningful?

A person can look at one image and decode meaning instantly. We are trying to help machines decipher and organize what is meaningful so they can share that meaning at scale (search engines) and help those who canâ€™t see to navigate web pages. We help the machines by surrounding our content in markers (i.e., tags) so that machine algorithms can catalog the meaning of a page based on those tags and attributes.
